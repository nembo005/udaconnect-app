Architecture Decisions

*** 3 message passing techniques were used:
- REST APIs  - most used technique. Industry standard
- gRPC  - mission specific mearnt for 
- Message Queues(Kafka)

> Persons and Connections services:
The frontend client uses REST APIs to easily integrate with HTTP routes of Persons and Connections services. REST was chosen because it is the industry standard, 
offers an easy endpoint format and it gives high throughput in API performance.

> Locations ingester service
gRPC was chosen for ingesting large volume of location data from users' mobile devices. 
The reason for the choice was to leverage on the improved performance provided by gRPC 

> Locations saver service
The location saver service utilizes a message queue (Kafka) to handle the ingested location data. This helps in achieving improved reliability, improved performance and also enable decoupling of our services.
